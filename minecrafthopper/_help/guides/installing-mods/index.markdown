# Installing mods
Mods are pieces of code (usually in JAR files) which change the way the game works. Mods are not created or regulated by Mojang, so some of them may contain malicious code or explicit content. One of the best and safest places to get mods and modpacks is [CurseForge](https://curseforge.com/minecraft), but you should still be careful.

Most mods require a **mod loader** to run. The two most common ones are [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net), for mods like the ReplayMod, the Carpet Mod or Sodium; or [Forge](https://minecraftforge.net) For mods and modpacks such as RLCraft, SkyFactory, JEI and JourneyMap. We have a guide on how to install Fabric mods [here](/help/guides/installing-mods/fabric/), and a guide on how to install Forge mods [here](/help/guides/installing-mods/forge/)
