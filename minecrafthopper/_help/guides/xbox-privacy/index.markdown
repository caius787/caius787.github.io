# Microsoft Account Privacy Settings

A number of Minecraft users use Microsoft accounts to log in to Minecraft. In order to play multiplayer Minecraft, these accounts must have certain privacy settings enabled. Sometimes users can change these privacy settings themselves, but sometimes they must ask a parent/guardian to change these settings for them.

## What is a Microsoft/Xbox Account and Who Has One?

A Microsoft account is the base account system that comprises many components such as OneDrive, Office, Windows, Xbox, etc. Xbox accounts are used to manage game components that use Microsoft accounts, especially multiplayer.

Xbox accounts were first used with the Bedrock Edition of Minecraft. For better account security, privacy protections, and other benefits, Mojang accounts, which was *Minecraft: Java Edition*'s main account system from 2013 until 2020, began to be migrated to Microsoft accounts starting in early 2021.

As of December, 2020, all new purchases of *Minecraft: Java Edition* were made on Microsoft accounts, and it is no longer possible to create Mojang accounts, nor is it possible to purchase *Minecraft: Java Edition* on Mojang accounts.

In summary, this guide applies to:
* All players of Minecraft Bedrock Edition (on Windows 10, mobile devices, and consoles)
* Players of *Minecraft: Java Edition* that purchased the game on or after December 1, 2020.
* Players of *Minecraft: Java Edition* that purchased the game on or before November 30, 2020, that have migrated to Microsoft accounts via an official notice in the launcher (**as of the writing of this article, migration has not yet begun**)

**This does not apply to those still on Mojang accounts.** If you on a Mojang account and are being prompted for parental consent, follow the instructions provided by Minecraft to provide consent with a parent's credit card.

## Determine if You Have a Privacy Setting Issue

Some indicators that the Xbox privacy settings need to be changed:

#### Java
* "Failed to login: null" error message when trying to play multiplayer.
* On the main title screen, the Multiplayer and Realms buttons are blacked out.

#### Bedrock
* Multiplayer menus show that realms/shared worlds/servers are disabled due to Microsoft account settings.

## Changing Xbox Privacy Settings

#### IMPORTANT: If you are not considered an adult in your country, you cannot change these settings yourself {#underage}

Only adults will be able to change privacy settings. Regardless of how your Microsoft account is set up now, you will **not be able to change your privacy settings unless you are added to a Microsoft family** by your parents/guardians. Your parent/guardian must follow the remainder of this guide to grant you access to multiplayer on your Xbox account.

#### Is my Microsoft account considered underage?

Try going to (https://account.xbox.com/settings) in your browser. If, after logging in to your Xbox account you see the page in the screenshot below, your account is considered underage and your parents/guardian need to give you permission to play multiplayer. Continue with the instructions on this page.
