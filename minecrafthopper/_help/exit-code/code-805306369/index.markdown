# Exit code -805306369
This exit code is caused when the client runs out of memory.<br>

This can be caused by the JVM not being allocated enough memory, a bug in the game, using client modifications or a dependency of the game that has unexpectedly terminated.
#### How to fix this
- See [this article](/help/out-of-memory/) on instructions to allocate more memory.
- [Run an ADWCleaner scan](https://downloads.malwarebytes.com/file/adwcleaner)
- [Run a Malwarebytes scan](https://support.malwarebytes.com/docs/DOC-1156)
- [Reinstall minecraft](/help/reinstalling-minecraft/) to ensure you have no client mods.
- [Check your System Event Log for issues.](/help/using-event-viewer/)
