# Special Characters
## Fixing crashes related to 'special' characters in Windows Account names

Having an exclamation point (!), or some non-English Alphanumeric characters in your Windows User Account name will cause the game to crash.

In some cases you can fix this by changing the working directory the game uses to a path that does not contain an explanation point by following the instructions [here](/help/guides/changing-work-directory/).

If that does not resolve the issue, you will need to create a new local Windows User Account containing only English alphanumernic characters (a to z, A to Z, 0 to 9).

* Changing your Windows User Account name will not correct the issue. You ***must*** create a new Windows User Account.
