# Unable to fit texture
This crash is caused by Minecraft being unable to handle a texture, due to insufficient video memory.

Common workarounds include reverting to the default resource pack, disabling Anisotropic Filtering or allocating more memory to the game.

### How to fix this

#### Switch to the default resource pack
Go to the [Minecraft folder](https://minecraftirc.net/hopper/finding-minecraft-data-folder/)
Open `options.txt`
Change the line that starts with `resourcepacks:` to `resourcepacks:[]`
Save and close the file
Run Minecraft normally

#### Give Minecraft more memory
Your computer may not have enough memory available for this option
